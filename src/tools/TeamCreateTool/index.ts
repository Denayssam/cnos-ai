WHEN TO USE: Only when tasks have NO shared files and NO data dependencies between them.
Each sub-agent receives a fresh, isolated context — be explicit and self-contained in each task description.
The engine will run all agents with Promise.all and the FileLockManager will prevent file collisions.
EXAMPLE: { "team": [{"agent":"coder","task":"Build REST endpoints in src/api/..."},{"agent":"designer","task":"Create UI components in src/components/..."}] }`,

      type: 'object',
